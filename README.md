# Backend-API-Tester
This repository contains a simple, lightweight Node.js + Express backend created specifically for frontend developers to test their applications without needing a real database or complex backend setup.  It provides ready to use dummy API endpoints that simulate real backend behavior for learning, prototyping, and UI development.
